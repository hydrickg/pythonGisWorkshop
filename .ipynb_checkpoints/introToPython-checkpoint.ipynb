      "Hmmm, what happened?  A `string literal`? What we haven't told you is that Python uses the backslash as an escape character. Python was constructed to use only forward slashes (`/`) in file paths. The backslash (\\\\) is a character that tells Python not to evaluate that character as it normally would, this is referred to as an escape character or escaping certain characters. Suffice it to say that Python wants to see a forward slash in file paths and Windows used backslashes. The error has occured because Python thinks we've told it to *not* consider the second double quotes as closing the first so Python throws an error, saying that its reached the end of the line (`EOL`) with quote not close. (Also note Python has automatically added a second backslash in the string object, telling itself that it is really a backslash, it is actually *escaping* the backslash. If we were to use the `print` function on this string value, we would not see the double backslashing because `print` is making a pretty output for us to read, try `\"\\t a tab\"` and then `print \"\\t a tab\"` to see the difference. The `\\t` is a tab, here we are escaping the 't' to mean not a real 't', but a tab.)\n",

      "Back to our example, the double backslashes here mean that Python understands we mean to separate the directories from each other but its interpreting the `\\\"` as if we're saying, don't look at those double quotes as ending or closing our string. Its good practice to take steps to make sure that Python will correctly read these strings as file paths. One could use only forward slashes when working with Python (this could be an issue if you are writing commands to be passed to the Windows command shell) or use an \"`r`\" before the file path, this tells Python to interpret this as a raw strings, e.g., r\"C:\\gis_data\\county_files\". These steps ensure that our file paths are read correctly. \n",

Now that you have your new Toolbox you can create a script tool by rt-clicking your new toolbox, and click **Add > Script**.  This will open the Add Script wizard which takes you step by step through the process of creating a script tool.

While ESRI has been building better bindings with Python, Python has been building better analytical tools such as [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), and my personal favorite although it's not included in the ArcGIS distribution of Python, [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/).
